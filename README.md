### Why does this repository exists?

Why does this repository exists? The answer may be difficult to understand at first but let's try...

This repository have been created in order to help with the creation of fully functional platforms that non technician can use to create and develop the promotional plan with activities for events especially, OpenForum targets Forums.

### What does this project offer?

This project comes with some features out of the box:

* Dynamic event days and location definition
* Reservation date-time range restriction
* Whitelisted users
* Dynamic, predictable, password generation for whitelisted users
* Email verification and reservation confirmation notification

Some functionality may be accessed only within the attached frontend while other can be accessed via API.\
To access the API specification please refer to the appropriate section.

### Ending notes

This is not a bootstraped complete forum creation platform, it is instead an administrative panel implementation that can be easily integrated with any frontend technology (via API) in order to create a fully featured event promotional with reservation capabilities platform.

**Why no end-user frontend is provided?**

The answer's easy, the front-end is where the users will land for reservation, event and activity information retrieval, multiple front-end can be developed and attached to an administration API without much effort, while creating a predefined one will reduce the possibility of customization.
