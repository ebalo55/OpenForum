# Introduction

Welcome to the **OpenForum** project, a fully functional platform that aims to make the creation and development of informative plans for forums and events easy for non-technicians. This project was created to provide a fully configurable and easily integrated web application for displaying scheduled events and allowing people to reserve event participation in one of many sites.

### Why does this repository exist?

The traditional approach to creating forum and event web applications requires technical expertise and is not easily configurable. This limitation creates a barrier for non-technicians who want to develop and manage forums, especially with low budgets.

The OpenForum project aims to solve this problem by providing a fully featured source code for the admin and client side of the web app. The main goal is to provide the highest configurable application and the easiest front-end integration.

### What does this project offer?

The OpenForum project provides a source code for the administration and client sides of a web app. The application's final goal is to display scheduled events and allow people to reserve event participation in one of many sites.

The application offers a highly configurable platform that is easy to integrate with any front-end. This platform is designed to provide the easiest front-end integration, with customizable features that can be adapted to the specific needs of each forum or event.

The application offers only the administration side of the full final application needed in a typical forum or event app. The front end is where users will land for reservation, and multiple front-ends can be developed and attached to the administration API without any effort.

Using a predefined front end reduces the possibility of changes and customization this is the reason we've chosen to provide a convenient and easy-to-use platform for non-technicians who want to create and manage forums with powerful API to integrate any custom-developed front end.

### Documentation

The OpenForum project comes with online documentation hosted on [this official documentation link](https://app.gitbook.com/s/EqPTxBs77BdlGcGLn0U0/). The documentation includes a user guide, API documentation and much more.

These resources provide a comprehensive guide to using and customizing the application to meet the specific needs of each student forum.
