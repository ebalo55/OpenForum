## Why does this repository exists?

Why does this repository exists? The answer may be difficult to understand at first but let's try...

This repository have been created by me, Ebalo, in order to help with the creation of fully functional platforms that
non technician can use to create and develop the informative plan for a student forum.

This was especially needed as not everyone is able to build something that works easily and is fully configurable,
unless not in high schools.

## What does this repo offers?

The answer's pretty easy, this repo offers a fully featured source code for the admin and client side of a web app whose
final goal is to display scheduled events and let people register in one of many sites.

The main goal here is to provide the highest configurable application and the easiest front-end integration.

## Ending notes

This application offers only the administration side of the full final application needed in a typical Student Forum
app.

#### Why?

The answer's easy, the front-end is where the users will land for registration, multiple front-end can be developed and
attached to an administration api without any effort, while creating a predefined one will reduce the possibility of
changes and customization.

## Documentation

This repo comes with an online documentation hosted on the administration panel itself.
