# Email verification and reservation confirmation notification

This feature requires all users to provide an email and confirm it before they are allowed to reserve any spot for the event.

The email verification process has a double function. First, it is used to grant user security as it ensures only real people can reserve spots. Second, email is used to communicate with the user by sending notifications, such as the reservation confirmation notification that is sent each time a reservation is completed.

When a user reserves a spot, the system will send a reservation confirmation notification to the user's verified email address. This notification will include all the details of the reservation, such as the day, time, and location of the reserved activity.

This feature ensures that users have a way to verify their reservations and keep track of all their reserved activities. It also provides the event administrators with a way to communicate with users and keep them informed about any changes or updates to the event schedule.
