# Whitelisted users

The "Whitelisted users" feature in OpenForum allows administrators to define a list of users allowed to reserve spots in the event.

Non-whitelisted users cannot reserve a spot in the event. This means that if no user is whitelisted, no one will be able to reserve a spot in the event. Only users who are on the whitelist can reserve spots.

Furthermore, whitelisted users must authenticate themselves in order to be able to reserve a spot in the event. This helps ensure that only authorized users are able to access and reserve spots. Each user must provide and verify their email before being able to reserve a spot in the event. This further ensures that the user is authorized to access the event and prevents unauthorized users from accessing the event.
