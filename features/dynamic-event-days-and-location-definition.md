# Dynamic event days and location definition

The "Dynamic event days and location definition" feature in OpenForum allows administrators to define a date range and multiple locations for an event.

To define a date range for the event, simply enter a start date and an end date. The date range must be sequential, meaning that if the date range starts on May 5 and ends on May 10, all the days in that range will be included in the event date range. This ensures that the event is held on consecutive days.

In addition to defining a date range, administrators can also define multiple locations for the event. For example, some activities can be held in a theatre while others can be held on a college campus. This allows the event to be held in multiple locations at the same time.

Defining days and locations automatically generates day-location pairs for each of the defined days and locations. This allows for the individual definition of activities for each day and location, creating a unique identifier for each day-location pair. This ensures that each activity is assigned to the correct day and location, making it easy for users to find and register for activities.
